# Random Clocks
Python script that generates random analogue clocks as a pdf file.
This can then be printed and my 8y old son used it to practice for his exam.

Install and execute:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python random_clocks.py
```

Open the output file. The hours are random and the minutes are random with 5 minute increments.
First page is with solutions. Second page is to be filled in.

```
$ open analogue_clocks.pdf
```

An example output pdf is also included. But you can re-run the script and get different clocks each time.
